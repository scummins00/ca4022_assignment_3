# ca4022_assignment_3
This repository will host the notebooks and associated files for the third assignment of CA4022.

For this assignment, we will be investigating the salaries received by employees in *Science*, *Technology*, *Engineering*, and *Math* (**STEM**) related positions including *Data Scientists*. The dataset used can be accessed online Via Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jackogozaly/data-science-and-stem-salaries).

In our analysis, we will be using Apache Pig for data cleaning. We'll use Apache Spark for data analysis, and specifically Apache SparkML for building a predictive model.

## Jupyter Book
The code we have used in our analyses has been added to a Jupyter Book which can be accessed through [here](https://scummins00.github.io/ca4022_assignment_3/introduction.html).
