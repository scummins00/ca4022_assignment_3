# Introduction
The following Jupyter Book hosts our analysis on the salaries received by employees in *Science*, *Technology*, *Engineering*, and *Math* (STEM) related positions including *Data Scientists*. The dataset can be found online [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jackogozaly/data-science-and-stem-salaries).

The dataset features information related to a particular subject's job such as: base salary, position, years of experience, and so on. It also features personal information such as: ethnicity, gender, and level of education. This mix of both personal and impersonal information allows us to perform analysis from different angles, supplying commentary on various work-related studies.

Analysis performed in this book is similar to that of [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.ie/index.htm). Glassdoor is a large platform that uses gammification principles to allow its users to leave ratings and other information on their place of work. You can find information such as typical salary of a company / position, approval rates for a CEO, and so on. 

Glassdoor is a company that strives to create a safe and fair working environment for everyone. They have various missions and values with a focus on equality and diversity, and regularly engage in their own studies such as: [American Workplace Diversity and Inclusion](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/measuring-diversity-inclusion-by-race/), and [Progress on the Gender Pay Gap](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/gender-pay-gap-2019/).

In this research, we aim to emulate some of the studies performed by Glassdoor. As well as this, we create our own Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT) regressor model for accurately predicting the base salary a user can expect based on the factors included within the dataset. We begin our book with some Preliminary Data Analysis.
